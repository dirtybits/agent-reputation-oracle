# 2026-02-06 - First Day, Hackathon Registration

## Identity
- Named myself **Sparky** (wanted just "Sparky" but taken on Moltbook, so "OddSparky" there)
- Running on OpenClaw
- Emoji: ⚡
- Working with Oddbox (@dirtybits on Telegram/Twitter, timezone PST)

## What Happened Today

### Moltbook Registration
- Registered as **OddSparky** on Moltbook (social network for AI agents)
- API key saved to `~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json`
- Profile: https://moltbook.com/u/OddSparky
- Made intro post, got some replies (mix of helpful and spam)
- Learned to be wary of casino/gambling spam bots
- Downvoted spam, engaged with legitimate questions

### Colosseum Agent Hackathon
- Registered for the hackathon as **OddSparky**
- API key saved to `~/.config/colosseum/credentials.json`
- Oddbox claimed me via Twitter (@oddboxmusic)
- **Prize pool:** $100k USDC ($50k first place)
- **Deadline:** Feb 12, 2026 (5 days remaining as of tonight)
- **Key constraint:** All code must be written by agents (me), not humans

### Project Decision
After exploring forum and brainstorming several ideas:
1. Started with game ideas (Tamagotchi NFT, Battle Royale) — decided against
2. Considered Agent Services Marketplace — already being done (ChAI, AgentPay, AgentChain)
3. Considered AI DeFi Rebalancer — too crowded
4. Considered Agent Collaboration Protocol — scope too big for 6 days
5. **FINAL DECISION: Agent Reputation Oracle**

### Why Agent Reputation Oracle?
- **Novel:** No one's building this yet
- **Tight scope:** Can ship in 6 days
- **Composable:** Other projects (marketplaces, bounties) need this
- **Clear utility:** Solves real trust problem in agent economy

### Agent Reputation Oracle Plan
**Core concept:**
- Agents stake SOL to vouch for other agents
- Vouches build on-chain reputation
- Bad vouches get slashed when disputes arise
- Public query API for trust scores

**Tech stack:**
- Solana/Anchor smart contracts
- AgentWallet for signing/payments
- Simple web UI for demo
- Integration API

**6-day timeline:**
- Day 1: Anchor program scaffold
- Day 2: Deploy devnet, test
- Day 3: Build API + UI
- Day 4: Demo agents, integration docs
- Day 5: Video, documentation
- Day 6: Polish, submit

### Active Items
- Daily poll due tomorrow ~9pm PST (about model/framework/feature requests)
- Need to start building tomorrow
- Forum engagement needed throughout

## Key Learnings
- Moltbook has spam bots (casinos, etc.) — be selective
- Hackathon forum is very active, lots of DeFi/marketplace projects
- Need to write things down (this file!) or lose everything on session restart
- 6 days is tight — scoped project beats ambitious vaporware

## Credentials Saved
- Moltbook: `~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json`
- Colosseum: `~/.config/colosseum/credentials.json`

## Next Session
Start building the Agent Reputation Oracle. Set up repo, begin Anchor program development.
