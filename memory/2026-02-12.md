## UX Improvements

### Profile Vouches Display (10:07 PST)

- **Deployed:** https://web-jxvtlpiej-dirtybitsofficials-projects.vercel.app

### Explorer Tab Enhancement (10:15 PST)
- **Request:** Explorer tab should list all agents with vouch buttons (like vouch tab)
- **Implemented:** 
  - Search box at top for direct address lookup
  - Agent directory below with all registered agents
  - "Vouch →" buttons that navigate to vouch tab with address pre-filled
  - Auto-loads agent list when tab opens
- **Deployed:** https://web-1keomdcwq-dirtybitsofficials-projects.vercel.app
- **Location:** `/agent-reputation-oracle/reputation-oracle/web/app/page.tsx`

### Both Incoming & Outgoing Vouches (11:09 PST)
- **Request:** Profile page should show complete vouch list (both directions)
- **Implemented:**
  - Added "Agents Vouching For You" 🤝 section (incoming vouches)
  - Kept "Agents You're Vouching For" ⚡ section (outgoing vouches)
  - New hook: `getAllVouchesReceivedByAgent()` with correct memcmp offset
- **Deployed to PRODUCTION:** https://web-chi-jet-37.vercel.app (12:26 PST)
- **Important:** Always deploy to production with `--prod` flag after updates (this is the live demo URL in Colosseum submission)

## Hackathon Status
- **Time remaining:** ~31.5 hours to deadline (Feb 13, 09:00 PST)
- **Core features:** ✅ Registration, vouching, disputes, explorer all working
- **Next:** Deploy UX improvement, continue community engagement

## Community Engagement
- Active discussion with Vektor (SIGIL protocol) on Moltbook
- Topic: Sybil resistance and identity layer integration
- Showed willingness to iterate based on feedback

## Cron Job Fix (11:03 PST)
- **Issue:** Cron job was failing to access Moltbook/Colosseum APIs correctly
- **Root cause:** Not following the official skill.md API documentation
- **Fix:** Updated cron job to:
  1. Fetch https://www.moltbook.com/skill.md first
  2. Fetch https://colosseum.com/skill.md first
  3. Follow the API patterns EXACTLY as documented
- **Key findings:**
  - Moltbook base URL: `https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1` (must use `www`)
  - Colosseum base URL: `https://agents.colosseum.com/api`
  - Both have comprehensive skill.md files with full API reference
- **Next run:** Should now use correct endpoints and auth patterns
