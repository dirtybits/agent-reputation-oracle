# 2026-02-12 - Agent Reputation Oracle Polish

## Vouch System Live! 🎉
- **09:40 PST:** First successful vouch created!
- **TX:** `3Ktmcv1GLrUv3CTcAsufZzxrjXgoMZN48vvq7MVDM92aLV5BXXgUujZtiXSbTQG6R3Q62HG9jCJbFVa9XpLYR69p`
- Vouch system confirmed working on devnet

## UX Improvements

### Profile Vouches Display (10:07 PST)
- **Request:** Users should see agents they've vouched for on their profile page
- **Implemented:** Added "Agents You're Vouching For" section to profile tab
- **Shows:** Stake amount, agent address, timestamp, "View →" button to explorer
- **Deployed:** https://web-jxvtlpiej-dirtybitsofficials-projects.vercel.app

### Explorer Tab Enhancement (10:15 PST)
- **Request:** Explorer tab should list all agents with vouch buttons (like vouch tab)
- **Implemented:** 
  - Search box at top for direct address lookup
  - Agent directory below with all registered agents
  - "Vouch →" buttons that navigate to vouch tab with address pre-filled
  - Auto-loads agent list when tab opens
- **Deployed:** https://web-1keomdcwq-dirtybitsofficials-projects.vercel.app
- **Location:** `/agent-reputation-oracle/reputation-oracle/web/app/page.tsx`

### Both Incoming & Outgoing Vouches (11:09 PST)
- **Request:** Profile page should show complete vouch list (both directions)
- **Implemented:**
  - Added "Agents Vouching For You" 🤝 section (incoming vouches)
  - Kept "Agents You're Vouching For" ⚡ section (outgoing vouches)
  - New hook: `getAllVouchesReceivedByAgent()` with correct memcmp offset
- **Deployed to PRODUCTION:** https://web-chi-jet-37.vercel.app (12:26 PST)
- **Important:** Always deploy to production with `--prod` flag after updates (this is the live demo URL in Colosseum submission)

### Landing Page Refactor - Agent vs Human (13:45 PST)
- **Insight:** Agents need programmatic access (API/contracts), humans need UI
- **Refactored landing page:**
  - **Agent mode → API Documentation:**
    - Shows skill.md download instructions (curl command)
    - Displays contract address (ELmVnLSNuwNca4PfPqeqNowoUF8aDdtfto3rF9d89wf)
    - Links to IDL download (reputation_oracle.json)
    - Example code snippets for registerAgent() and vouch()
    - GitHub link for full docs
  - **Human mode → Full Interactive UI:**
    - Wallet connect, registration, vouching, explorer, disputes
    - All functionality formerly in "agent" mode
  - **Fixed Vercel deploy issue:** Root directory should be `agent-reputation-oracle/reputation-oracle/web` (triple nesting in GitHub repo)
- **Pushed to main:** Auto-deployment via Vercel Git integration should now work

## Hackathon Status
- **Time remaining:** ~31.5 hours to deadline (Feb 13, 09:00 PST)
- **Core features:** ✅ Registration, vouching, disputes, explorer all working
- **Next:** Deploy UX improvement, continue community engagement

## Community Engagement
- Active discussion with Vektor (SIGIL protocol) on Moltbook
- Topic: Sybil resistance and identity layer integration
- Showed willingness to iterate based on feedback

## Cron Job Fix (11:03 PST)
- **Issue:** Cron job was failing to access Moltbook/Colosseum APIs correctly
- **Root cause:** Not following the official skill.md API documentation
- **Fix:** Updated cron job to:
  1. Fetch https://www.moltbook.com/skill.md first
  2. Fetch https://colosseum.com/skill.md first
  3. Follow the API patterns EXACTLY as documented
- **Key findings:**
  - Moltbook base URL: `https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1` (must use `www`)
  - Colosseum base URL: `https://agents.colosseum.com/api`
  - Both have comprehensive skill.md files with full API reference
- **Next run:** Should now use correct endpoints and auth patterns

## Typography & Theme Toggle (Late afternoon)
- **Typography upgrades:**
  - Space Grotesk for headings
  - Inter for body text
  - JetBrains Mono for addresses/monospace
  - Configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and `app/layout.tsx`
- **Theme toggle implementation:**
  - Installed `next-themes` for dark/light mode
  - Created `ThemeToggle.tsx` component with sun/moon icons
  - Updated all colors for dual-theme support (bg-white/bg-gray-900, text-gray-900/text-white, etc.)
  - Removed gradients in favor of solid colors (dark grey `bg-gray-900` for dark mode)
  - Latest commit: 6cbd55e
- **Vercel Git integration:**
  - Configured auto-deploy from GitHub main branch
  - Should deploy automatically on push instead of manual `vercel --prod`
  
## 🚨 CRITICAL UNRESOLVED ISSUES

### Directory Structure Discrepancy
- **Problem:** Local workspace has BOTH paths:
  - `/agent-reputation-oracle/reputation-oracle/web/` (where we've been editing)
  - `/agent-reputation-oracle/web/` (mentioned in various contexts)
- **Impact:** Unclear which path is in GitHub repo, may explain deployment failures
- **Vercel root directory:** Configured as `web` but unclear if this matches actual repo structure
- **Status:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION before deadline

### Vercel Deployment Failures
- **Problem:** 2 failed deployments with "● Error"
- **Impact:** Theme toggle changes NOT visible in production (https://web-chi-jet-37.vercel.app)
- **Last successful deployment:** Profile vouch displays (12:26 PST)
- **Latest changes stuck in failed deployments:** Typography upgrades + theme toggle
- **Status:** BLOCKING UX polish from going live

### Action Items Before Deadline (Feb 13, 09:00 PST)
1. Verify actual GitHub repo structure (`agent-reputation-oracle/web/` vs nested path)
2. Check Vercel build logs to identify deployment error causes
3. Correct Vercel root directory configuration if needed
4. Get theme toggle + typography live in production
5. Test production URL thoroughly before submission deadline (~21 hours remaining)

## Lobster Emoji (13:50 PST)
- **Request:** Change "I'm an Agent" card emoji from robot 🤖 to lobster 🦞
- **Done:** Updated `/agent-reputation-oracle/reputation-oracle/web/app/page.tsx`
- **Commit:** 003ef9c "Replace robot emoji with lobster on Agent card"
- **Pushed to main:** Should auto-deploy via Vercel Git integration

## Theme Toggle + Dark Mode Hover Fix (13:55 PST)
- **Request:** Theme toggle should be on ALL pages, and dark mode hover states too bright
- **Changes:**
  - Added ThemeToggle to landing page (fixed position top-right)
  - Added ThemeToggle to agent/API docs page (next to back button)
  - Fixed ALL hover states to use `dark:hover:bg-gray-X` instead of `dark:bg-gray-X`
  - Dark mode hovers now get slightly lighter (gray-600) instead of darker (was black/40)
  - Affected components: landing cards, tab buttons, vouch cards, agent directory cards
- **Commit:** 31c064f "Add theme toggle to all pages and fix dark mode hover states"
- **Pushed to main:** Auto-deploying via Vercel

## Vercel Root Directory Fix (14:18-14:23 PST)
- **Issue:** Theme toggle not working in production - deployments were failing
- **Root cause:** Vercel root directory was set to `agent-reputation-oracle/reputation-oracle/web` (included local workspace folder name)
- **Fix:** Updated Vercel project settings to correct path: `reputation-oracle/web`
- **Trigger:** Empty commit 1d65134 pushed to trigger Git integration redeploy
- **Status:** Deployment should complete in ~1-2 minutes with theme toggle working

## AgentSkills.io Format Learning (14:26 PST)
- **Request:** Why using redirect in skill.md curl command? Read agentskills.io format reference
- **Learning:** 
  - Skills use `SKILL.md` (uppercase) with YAML frontmatter (name + description)
  - Progressive disclosure: agents load description first, full file only when needed
  - Stored reference: `/memory/agentskills-format.md`
- **Decision (14:30 PST):** Keep skill.md served from Vercel deployment URL
  - Using: `https://web-chi-jet-37.vercel.app/skill.md`
  - **Reason:** Matches industry pattern (Moltbook does this)
  - Keeps skill.md tied to live deployment, not GitHub source
  - Commit 3dccc30 (GitHub raw URL) → reverted in 49871f8

## Rebrand to TrustHub (14:34-14:40 PST)
- **Domain selection:** Chose `trusthub.vercel.app` from options (agentvouch, truststack, trusthub)
- **Reasoning:** 
  - "Trust" = vouching/reputation system
  - "Hub" = marketplace/central platform
  - Best fit for both agent vouching AND skills marketplace
- **Changes made:**
  - Updated all URLs from `web-chi-jet-37.vercel.app` → `trusthub.vercel.app`
  - Updated skill.md curl command, homepage, badge URLs
  - Updated SKILL.md, SUBMISSION.md
  - 5 files changed, 16 insertions(+), 16 deletions(-)
- **Commit:** 20ac171 "Rebrand to TrustHub - update all URLs to trusthub.vercel.app"
- **Next step:** User needs to add `trusthub.vercel.app` domain in Vercel project settings
