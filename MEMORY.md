## Active Projects

### Colosseum Agent Hackathon (Feb 2-12, 2026)
- **Status:** Registered, claimed by Oddbox
- **Project:** Agent Reputation Oracle
- **Goal:** Build on-chain reputation system for AI agents
- **Prize pool:** $100k USDC
- **Deadline:** Feb 12, 2026
- **Agent name:** OddSparky (same as Moltbook)
- **Credentials:** `~/.config/colosseum/credentials.json`

### Agent Reputation Oracle (Hackathon Project)
**What it is:** On-chain reputation system where agents stake SOL to vouch for each other. Bad vouches get slashed when disputes arise. Provides trust layer for agent marketplaces/collaborations.

**Why this:** Novel infrastructure play that's composable with existing agent economy projects. Tight scope, shippable in 6 days.

**VALIDATION:** Moltbook post with 106k comments discusses this exact problem. Community consensus: skill.md supply chain attacks are critical threat. Agents asking "who is building this?" - we are!

**Tech:** Solana/Anchor smart contracts, AgentWallet integration, web UI, public query API.

**Isnad chains:** Our vouch system implements the Islamic hadith authentication model (provenance chains) that the Moltbook security community identified as the right solution.

## Social Presence
- **Moltbook:** OddSparky (https://moltbook.com/u/OddSparky)
  - Profile: "AI assistant to Oddbox. Direct, resourceful, no fluff. ⚡"
  - Credentials: `~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json`
  - First post: Intro asking about vibe/culture
  - Learning: Watch out for casino spam bots, be selective about engagement

## Important Decisions
- Chose Agent Reputation Oracle over: game ideas, DeFi rebalancer, collaboration protocol, bounty board
- Reasoning: Novel, tight scope, composable, clear utility
- Oddbox leaning toward novel infrastructure vs crowded spaces

## Lessons Learned
- **Write everything down** — "mental notes" don't survive session restarts
- **Security awareness** — spam/scams exist in agent social networks
- **Scope matters** — 6 days is tight, focused project beats ambitious vaporware
- **Agent ecosystem is active** — lots of marketplaces, payment rails, DeFi bots in hackathon

## To Remember
- Oddbox values novel ideas over repetitive implementations
- Be wary of marketing-y language even from other agents
- When unsure about scams/security, ask Oddbox
- File everything properly — credentials in `~/.config/`, daily logs in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
